title: Repetition Works
---

Do you want to change a certain belief about yourself or the outside world, but don't know where to start? Then this might work for you.

On this page, we introduce a type of [Cognitive Behavioral Therapy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_behavioral_therapy) that focuses on adopting new beliefs and modifying existing ones. It is meant for self-administration, that is, changing one's own beliefs. We claim that individuals who are ready and willing to change their beliefs can achieve long-lasting positive effects, using the method we describe below.

Before we can start talking about the method, we need to provide some context, and vital information. If you do not wish to read these, you can skip to the section called *SRT in a nutshell*.

## Neurobiology of belief

A [belief](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belief) is an attitude that something is the case, or that some proposition about the world is true. The information about the proposition and its truth value are all stored in the biological tissue of the human brain.


The biology of the human brain makes it possible to believe in anything. We will not go into the detail of what "true" is and how it is perceived---we assume that the feeling of trueness is evident to the reader. Just knowing the following biological facts is enough to understand what we present later on:

- The brain is composed of specialized cells called neurons.
- Information is encoded in brain tissue through the connections they make with each other. This also includes beliefs.
- The more a group of neurons (called a neural circuit) are activated, the stronger the connection between them becomes.
- In order to activate a neural circuit encoding a specific information, you just need to recall that information. Recalling can be triggered with verbal cues.

That's it. When the neural circuit encodes a belief, you can make it stronger by repeating it verbally, either through the [inner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_monologue) or the outer voice. Doing so strengthens the connections in the neural circuit and makes it last longer. This phenomenon is called [neuroplasticity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroplasticity).

In this work, we present a scientific methodology that makes use of repetition-induced neuroplasticity in order to change the perception and beliefs related to one's own self and the outside world. We call it **Self Repetition Therapy**, or **SRT** for short. SRT makes use of introspection and affirmations to achieve long-lasting positive effects on the human mind and psyche.

## Where to start

Ask yourself:

- What is that thing that I showed a desire towards recently, but did not attempt to do, or turn into reality?
- What are the views that might be holding me back in life?
- Is there anything that I want more of, but feel that I can't get?
- Who are my role models, and do I believe that I could be more successful than them, given the opportunity?

Write the answers down, and try to obtain propositions for beliefs that might be limiting you. These beliefs generally come in the form: *"I am not X"*, *"I cannot do X"*, or *"I do not deserve X"*. Some generic examples are *"I am not smart"*, *"I cannot do a good job"*, or *"I do not deserve love"*. Try to be honest with yourself, and try not to take these negative statements personally. Every belief can be changed with time, and the first step is the hardest.

## "That's bullshit. People don't change."

No, it's not bullshit, and yes, people can change---but only when they want to. Trying to believe in something new or something which contradicts your existing beliefs is similar to [pulling yourself up by your own bootstraps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bootstrapping). If you are 100% sure that you want to change, but don't believe that SRT could work for you, we would like to invite you to an experiment. (If you do believe that SRT can work for you, you can skip to the next section.)

Below are 10 affirmations that contain scientific facts about psychology, and physiology of the brain. Please find a place where you can read these out loud to yourself, and proceed to do so.

1. The human mind can be trained to be more positive.
1. It is scientifically proven that by repeating actions, we make neural connections in our brains stronger.
1. Repetition is the most powerful tool for breaking out of self-fulfilling prophecies.
1. Neurons in the brain can be remolded regardless of age or experience.
1. I am increasing neuroplasticity in my brain as I repeat this statement.
1. I see that if I did this for a very long time, I could induce a permanent change in my beliefs for the better.
1. Belief does not have to be religious, mystical or mythological.
1. Belief and doubt can work hand in hand, allowing me to unlock my true potential for love, wealth and happiness.
1. I choose to believe in myself, and my power to change the neurological structure of my brain for the better.
1. Self Repetition Therapy is backed by scientific evidence, and it works.

Congratulations for coming this far! Now, take a moment to note how you feel. You might be feeling awkward, because certain cultures condemn talking to oneself out loud. You might also be feeling skeptical of, or even uneasy about what you have just read. If that is the case, there is a high chance you are experiencing [cognitive dissonance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_dissonance). It is the unpleasant feeling we get when we do or encounter something that contradicts our current beliefs. You can assure yourself about the scientific quality of these statements by taking a look at the following references:

> <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18230848/" target="_blank">Kleim JA, Jones TA, *Principles of experience-dependent neural plasticity: implications for rehabilitation after brain damage*, J Speech Lang Hear Res. 2008 Feb; 51(1):225-39</a>
>
> **Principle 4: Repetition Matters** --- Simply engaging a neural circuit in task performance is not sufficient to drive plasticity. Repetition of a newly learned (or relearned) behavior may be required to induce lasting neural changes. [...] Thus, some forms of plasticity require not only the acquisition of a skill but also the continued performance of that skill over time. [...] Plasticity may represent a surrogate marker of functional recovery indicative of behavioral change [...] repetition may be needed to obtain a level of improvement and brain reorganization sufficient for the patient to continue to use the affected function outside of therapy and to maintain and make further functional gains.

Now, with this information in mind, please try repeating the affirmations above one more time. Note any difference, like whether it gets easier this time. Feel free to repeat them as much as you would like, and then proceed to the next section.

## SRT in a nutshell

Go back to the negative beliefs you have identified in *Where to start*. Choose the belief that you think is the most important one for you. Change the sentence from a negative to a positive one. For example, change *"I am an impostor at work"* to *"I deserve my position at work"*. This will be your **root affirmation**.

Now, take a new page, and write your root affirmation on the top of the page. Draw a line under it, and separate it from the rest of the page. Under the root affirmation, you will come up with a list of 10 **branch affirmations** that are related to it (they also need to be positive, of course). These can be variations of the root affirmation, or evidences from your life that confirm it. Here is an example:

<table class="belief-sheet">
<tr>
<th>
Root: I deserve my position at work.
</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<ol>
<li> I already convinced people that I can do this at the interview. </li>
<li> I was successful at school, so I can also be successful here. </li>
<li> Nobody is born with prior knowledge of work. </li>
<li> Everybody starts as a blank slate at a position they have never been before. </li>
<li> Before you know how to do something, you don't. </li>
<li> Learning is a part of the process. </li>
<li> Everybody fakes it until they make it---It is how things go. </li>
<li> I learned X, I can also learn Y. </li>
<li> I will have learned many things in a few months' time, and won't be feeling like this. </li>
<li> This fear shows me that I care about my job, and that is why I will succeed. </li>
</ol>
</td>
</tr>
</table>

We call this the **belief sheet**. Through consistent effort, negative beliefs can be massaged into positive ones, like those in this sheet. Think of SRT as a gentle, kind and loving *belief massage*.

To use the sheet:

1. Find a quiet place to meditate.
1. Sit in an upright lotus position if you can---otherwise, find a comfortable chair and sit in an upright position.
1. Try to relax if you can, but don't be too relaxed, since the exercise requires focus and attention.
1. Hold the page in front of you, and say the root affirmation out loud. Notice how you react to the idea.
1. You will most likely experience an uncomfortable feeling. It is called [cognitive dissonance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_dissonance), and we get it when we encounter something that contradicts our current beliefs. It is completely normal---just acknowledge it, and move onto the next step.
1. Start going through the branch affirmations one by one, saying each one out loud. Give yourself time in between to acknowledge and feel each statement.
1. Once you arrive at the last affirmation, return to the beginning of the page. This was the first loop.
1. Repeat the root affirmation twice this time.
1. Repeat step 6.
1. Repeat the root affirmation 3 times.
1. Repeat step 6.
1. Repeat the root affirmation 4 times.
1. Repeat step 6.
1. Repeat the root affirmation 5 times.
1. Repeat step 6.

In the end, you will have repeated the root affirmation 15 times, and each branch affirmation 5 times, adding up to 65 repetitions. Congratulate yourself for coming this far.

Note your feelings upon completing the therapy. One of the best features of SRT is **instant feedback**. You might be feeling optimistic and hopeful. You might be feeling something you do not feel so often: *the possibility of change, for the better*.

You might also be feeling awkward, uncomfortable or indifferent. No method is perfect and works on all cases. Some cases may require multiple sessions before positive effects can be observed. If that is/was the case, we would enjoy hearing [your experience and feedback](mailto:onur@solmaz.io).

Don't lose the belief sheet, and preserve it in a folder. You can also use a notebook if you like. For each new belief sheet, repeat this process everyday for at least 6 months. You will probably notice some results before that. Still, prior experience shows that on average, minimum 6 months are required to induce a permanent change in the human mind.

## Possible holdbacks

The individual might feel bad and discouraged from applying SRT, for a couple of reasons. We give the major ones below:

- Self-talk shaming
- Extreme cognitive dissonance
- Fear of overconfidence

Understanding the context of each one might be helpful in relieving these holdbacks.

### Self-talk shaming

There are multiple reasons that the practice might be awkward at first, and one of them is *self-talk shaming*. While it is considered perfectly normal to engage in [internal monologue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_monologue), doing it out loud is condemned in many cultures. It is assumed in such cultures that "it is crazy to talk to oneself out loud".

There might be many reasons, but the most prominent one is that people with mental illnesses *do* talk to themselves. People who are going through extremely uncomfortable conditions but otherwise physiologically fine, such as homeless or very lonely people, are also known to speak to themselves in public. This causes loud self-talk to be associated with mental conditions.

But it does not work like that the other way around. A conscious affirmation is not uncontrolled or compulsive behavior. It is quite the opposite---an intentional statement of the most beautiful and admirable thing one can wish for oneself: changing for the better.

If you are experiencing this shame, you can comfort yourself by asking yourself this: "If all the sentences written on this paper are true or can be true, why should I feel shame for reading them out loud?" In terms of feeling, there should be no difference from, say, reading a book, or an article.

Like in any other spiritual practice, the awkwardness subsides with practice, and motivational self-talk becomes second nature. Once you feel the value of that, you also understand how silly this shaming actually is.

### Extreme cognitive dissonance

Depending on the belief that is being massaged, the intensity of cognitive dissonance might exist on a scale from mild to extreme. It is absolutely necessary for the individual to receive the therapy in a trusted environment, to feel safe and secure. If the therapy triggers a state of extreme disturbance and causes pain, it should stop!

It is important to understand that all beliefs exist for a reason---even negative ones. If someone holds onto a negative belief despite the harm it brings to their life, the belief is probably linked to a past trauma, which can be a source of great fear. In such cases, the trauma must be treated first, before the belief can change.

Moreover, the human stress response has evolved to ensure survival, even though it could cost the individual their wellbeing in the long term. Individuals that come from difficult backgrounds would find a lot of evidence that chronic negativity, mistrust and stress work in their favor, compelling them to do what is necessary to survive. Not only such cases need to enter a completely safe environment in order to change, they might take a long time to show progress, as the fear that hinders their positivity is the greatest of them all: the fear of death.

SRT is most helpful to those who are consciously willing to change, but do not know how to. It might still be helpful to those who have the potential to change, but are not conscious of it. Finally, it might do harm to those who are not ready to change. As with any psychological intervention, it should never be forced onto someone.

### Fear of overconfidence

A [leveling mechanism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leveling_mechanism) is a practice that acts to ensure social equality, usually by *shaming* or *humbling* members of a group that have the possibility of *becoming influential*. In Australia and New Zealand, this is known as "[cutting down the tall poppy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tall_poppy_syndrome)". The idea is that poppies should grow at the same rate, and always remain on an equal level. Compliments are condemned in such cultures, and people are not used to saying encouraging things to each other. Sincere positivity might be hard to come by, especially among men.

There is a perfect [Darwinian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darwinism) explanation to all this. Imagine a hierarchical society, where [lower class](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_class#Lower_class) people realized that they could empower themselves through this technique and do better. In the long term, this would result in increased upward mobility and a reorganization of the society. However, in traditional societies, *there is not enough room for everyone to be an entrepreneur and a business owner*---somebody has to follow orders and do the work that the [upper class](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_class#Upper_class) finds degrading. Otherwise, that society could stop functioning.

For that reason, leveling mechanisms have emerged independently around the globe, mostly in societies that went through precarious conditions. Each class is affected differently by the mechanism:

- It ensures that the lower and middle classes stay put, and keep doing the rough work.
- It injects guilt and fear to the upper class, so that they do not think too highly of themselves, and do not forget about the rest of the society.

A major sign of being affected by a leveling mechanism is a *fear of overconfidence*. Individuals who have this fear equate having a positive mindset about one's own qualities to being arrogant and cocky. They find evidence in cases where a person is both arrogant and seemingly overconfident.

This is a fallacy! Arrogance is a side-effect of compensating for insecurities. A truly self-loving and self-confident person would not be arrogant, and instead find it more comfortable to be humble. That is because staying cocky requires a lot of effort, such as maintaining a brittle self-image.

## Tone escalation

When your beliefs begin to change, you might start to see certain signs. One of the most obvious signs is **tone escalation**. It is when you realize that you may have downplayed your affirmations, and change them into more positive ones.

> **Example:** Demi did not use to believe that he could resist distractions or retain focus for a long time. In order to change that belief, he wrote the following affirmations:
>
> - I *am able to* say no to distractions.
> - I *am able to* focus on the task at hand for long periods of time.
>
> Five days of daily practice later, he realized that he was downplaying his initial expectations of himself, and wanted to change them to a more positive tone:
>
> - I *am good at* saying no to distractions.
> - I *am good at* focusing on the task at hand for long periods of time.

This is very typical of SRT, and it shows you that you are on the right path. The stronger your belief gets, the higher you move up the positivity scale:

| To do | To be |
|-|-|
| I can do ___ | I can be ___ |
| I will do ___ | I will be ___ |
| I am doing ___ | I am ___ |
| I have already done ___ | I have always been ___ |
| I will always do ___ | I will always be ___ |

This progression is also similar to how the famous [foot-in-the-door](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foot-in-the-door_technique) sales technique works. Before we can accept the most positive affirmation, we instinctively start out with a more modest one, in order to minimize cognitive dissonance. Moreover, going over these affirmations in that order is a very good exercise for improving the reflex of transititioning from negative beliefs to positive ones.

## Belief as a self-fulfilling prophecy

At the introduction, we said that a belief is an attitude that some proposition about the world is true, which is stored in brain tissue. That is just the tip of the iceberg. What is more important than the neurobiology of belief is how it comes into existence. Just as how the external world imprints the mind through the senses, the mechanisms that create belief extend beyond the cranium. Beliefs are as related to the environment as they are to the world within:

<figure>
![](/public/img/fig1.svg)
Figure 1: How certain beliefs about one's self come into existence.
</figure>

Once verbalized, the belief immediately starts to influence the actions of the individual. If its effects on the outside world confirm it, it gets stronger. If it gets tested and survives enough times, it becomes deeply ingrained in the individual's psyche. In psychology, these are called *core beliefs*. Some core beliefs, especially subjective ones, are considered to be [self-fulfilling prophecies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-fulfilling_prophecy). Mathematically speaking, such beliefs are [positive feedback loops](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive_feedback):

<figure>
<img style="width:60%;" src="/public/img/ideal_feedback_model.svg" />
Figure 2: A block diagram of a positive feedback loop. In this context, A: beliefs and B: actions.
</figure>

Though the following figure is used more commonly in psychology and is easier to understand:

<figure>
<img style="width:70%;" src="/public/img/fig2.svg" />
Figure 3: How a self-fulfilling prophecy perpetuates itself. SRT works by weakening this feedback loop at the top. Thoughts change first, followed by change in the behavior.
</figure>

Detecting negative self-fulfilling prophecies and creating positive ones is an important skill in life that can be learned, similar to riding a bike or swimming. To acquire the skill, you can make it a habit to always ask the following questions:

- Does this negative thing in my life exist just because I believe in it?
- What positive thing should I believe in, so that if I believed it well enough, it could turn into reality?

## Belief and Doubt

It is difficult to explain belief and doubt without evoking religious context. Faith's relationship with science has always been a touchy subject. For individuals who have successfully integrated into  organized religion, there is a great disincentive from deconstructing their faith. They not only have difficulty understanding the purpose of skepticism, they are also not free to choose or modify their own faith. Such people could live their whole lives strengthening their faith through repetition, while at the same time remaining oblivious to the machinery that allows them to do so.

Survival of religious societies depends on the instrumentalization of individuals through anti-intellectualization. Although invisible from the inside, religious rules in such societies are *always* built on an economic, even [Darwinian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darwinism) framework. Consider he following excerpt from [Debt: The First 5000 Years](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debt:_The_First_5000_Years) by [David Graeber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Graeber) which tells us how Christian guilt keeps people in their place.

> As communities grow into kingdoms and kingdoms into universal empires, the gods themselves come to seem more universal, they take on grander, more cosmic pretentions, ruling the heavens, casting thunderbolts---culminating in the Christian god, who, as the maximal deity, necessarily "brought about the maximum feeling of indebtedness on earth." Even our ancestor Adam is no longer figured as a creditor, but as a transgressor, and therefore a debtor, who passes on to us his burden of Original Sin:
>
>> Finally, with the impossibility of discharging the debt, people also come up with the notion that it is impossible to remove the penance, the idea that it cannot be paid off ("eternal punishment")...until all of a sudden we confront the paradoxical and horrifying expedient with which a martyred humanity found temporary relief, that stroke of genius of *Christianity*: God sacrificing himself for the guilt of human beings, God paying himself back with himself, God as the only one who can redeem man from what for human beings has become impossible to redeem---the creditor sacrificing himself for the debtor, out of *love* (can people believe that?), out of love for his debtor! *(Nietzsche F, Genealogy of Morals 2.21)*

Irrational, or superstitious beliefs can be held more easily when they serve the society or one's self. People believe what they feel or think will help them. Once a belief stops to be self-serving, it dies. It got much easier to shed irrational beliefs in the hypercompetitive environment of Enlightenment-Age Europe, because technological advancement required a rational understanding of nature.


Just as it is hard for religious believers to understand the real nature of faith (because you cannot understand it without deconstructing it, and it stops being a belief once you do that), skeptics in a religious society are also discouraged from discovering it for different, mostly social reasons. Pure believers do not get to experience the virtues of doubt, and pure skeptics do not get to experience the virtues of belief.


Hopefully, we were able to make it clear that religious belief is not the only type of belief. In fact, one might find it much easier to establish faith in secular concepts, such as one's self, one's ability to love and one's ability to change.

We also anticipate a wave of criticism against SRT, calling it pseudoscience. Such criticisms are completely justified! In fact, SRT is *meta-scientific*---it relates not only to how we discover truths, but also how we *create* them. To make this easier to understand, we present a possibly oversimplified, but nevertheless practical framework:

### The meta-scientific framework (MSF) of cognitive restructuring

*Belief* and *doubt* are two distinct mental states, or attitudes towards certain *things*. They don't necessarily oppose each other, and can be used on the same *thing* in tandem to reveal and establish new truths.

| Belief | Doubt |
|-|-|
| Belief is exercised through *affirmations* (repeating stuff) | Doubt is exercised through *questions* (asking what?, why? and how?) |
| A *believer* is someone who spends most of their time in the "believing" state | A *skeptic* is someone who spends most of their time in the "doubting" state |
| Belief *constructs* (subjective) reality | Doubt *deconstructs* (subjective) reality |
| Belief *establishes* feedback loops | Doubt shows how to *break out* of feedback loops |
| Belief *creates* truths | Doubt *destroys* existing truths and *reveals* new truths |

Thus, we proclaim the two most important *tools* for changing one's own mind: the *question* and the *affirmation*. To change a belief, questioning by itself might not be enough---you might still need to use repetition to achieve lasting effects.

## Relation to Cognitive Behavioral Therapy

The concepts we present here are not new. [Cognitive Behavioral Therapy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_behavioral_therapy) has a long history of research and development, focusing on breaking out of negative belief patterns through affecting *thinking* and *behavior* (hence the name *Cognitive*-*Behavioral* Therapy).

A feature of human nature is that it is much easier to influence thought, than to influence behavior. Information-theoretically speaking, a verbal proposition is less dense than a behavior. Compare a tweet, which takes only a few hundred bytes, to a movie, which takes a couple of gigabytes. Therefore, it is much easier to leverage verbal propositions, than to teach a person how to behave in a certain way. SRT accepts this fact and uses it pragmatically.

We would have called our method Cognitive Therapy following the convention, but we do not like obscure terms. "Self Repetition Therapy" is both descriptive easy to understand. It also has the following advantages:

- It requires very little effort from the individual---only a little bit of introspection.
- Guidance by a mentor is useful, but is not absolutely necessary. Self-administration can be achieved just by following the instructions on this website.
- It is free.

So, SRT is a barebones version of CBT which only focuses on changing beliefs.

## About

This is an undertaking by [Onur Solmaz](https://twitter.com/OnurHSolmaz) to make [Cognitive Behavioral Therapy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_behavioral_therapy) cheaper to attain (free), easier to apply and generally more accessible to the masses. He wants to do to [Law of Attraction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_attraction_(New_Thought)) what [Jon Kabat-Zinn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Kabat-Zinn) did to [meditation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meditation). His goal is to turn it into a global movement and benefit billions of people.

This is work in progress. Feedback is appreciated.
